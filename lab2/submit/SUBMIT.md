Please answer the following questions:

1)Describe (as specifically as possible) the goal of your experiment.

**Answer :** To observe the throughput of the TCP variants[YeAH, Scalable and Reno] w.r.t. bandwidth delay product. 

What makes this a good goal?
explain *how* your selected goal embodies those indicators.

**Answer :** Because the goal specifically states :

1. the environment(TCP variants) where the experiment is conducted.
2. the  performance that is being measured (throughput).
3. the parameters(bandwidth delay product) that are varied in order to measure the mentioned metric. 

2) What is the TCP congestion control variant you have selected
as the main subject of your study? Describe briefly (1 paragraph)
what characterizes this TCP congestion control, and how it works.
Cite your sources.

**Answer :** 

**YeAH TCP**

YeAH TCP is a delay-aware state-enabled congestion control algorithm.
Through delay measures, when the network is sensed unloaded it will quickly exploit the available capacity, trying to keep the network buffer utilization always lower than a threshold. 
Moreover it is designed to be internal and RTT fair, Reno-friendly and resilient on lossy links.


3) What is the other LFN TCP you have selected to use in your
experiment? Be brief (1 paragraph each), and cite your
sources. 

**Answer :** 

**Scalable TCP**

This is another algorithm for WAN links with high bandwidth and RTT. 
One of its design goals is a quick recovery of the window size after a congestion event. 
It achieves this goal by resetting the window to a higher value than standard TCP.

What is the non-LFN TCP you have selected to use
in your experiment? Be brief (1 paragraph each), and cite your
sources. 

**Answer :** 

**TCP Reno**

TCP Reno is a classical model used for congestion control. 
It exhibits the typical slow start of transmissions. 
The throughput increases gradually until it stays stable. 
As soon as the transfer encounters congestion, the window size is reduced by a multiplicative decrease algorithm and then the rate rises again slowly. 
The window is increased by adding fixed values.

Why did you choose these specifically?

**Answer :** The TCP variants YeAh and Scalable are designed exclusively for LFNs whereas TCP Reno is the most widely deployed classical model used for congestion control, hence these variants were chosen in order to observe the throughput in both LFNs and Non-LFNs. 
Among the variants designed for LFNs, YeAH is a delay based while Scalable is a loss- based algorithm, hence this makes them significantly different.


4) Describe the parameters you have chosen to vary in your
experiment. 

**Answer :**

1. **TCP variant**
2. **Bandwidth Delay product**


Why did you choose these? How does this selection help further your stated goal?

**Answer :** In order to study the different TCP variants mentioned above TCP Variant is one of the parameters. 
And as modifying the Bandwidth-delay product has a direct impact on the throughput, it also is a parameter.

5) What metrics are you going to measure in your experiment?

**Answer :  Throughput.**

Why did you choose these? How does this selection help further your stated goal?

**Answer :** It is a clear goal of most congestion control mechanisms to maximize
throughput, subject to application demand and to the constraints of
the other metrics.

6) For each **experimental unit** in your experiment, describe:

* The specific parameters with which this experimental unit ran
* The names of all the data files which give results from this experimental unit. Include all of these files in this `submit` folder.
* The specific values of the metrics you have chosen to measure.

7) Describe any evidence of *interactions* you can see in the results of your experiment.

**Answer :** Varying the Delay results in changes in the throughput. They seem to be inversely proportional.

8) Briefly describe the results of your experiment (1-2 paragraphs). You may include images by putting them on an online
image hosting service, then putting the image URL in this file
using the syntax

Answer : 

**LFNs :** 

**With a high delay,** 

1. Throughput of YeAH is superior to Scalable whose throughput is in turn superior to TCP Reno. The reason behind this is the fact that YeAH and Scalable were designed for LFNs whereas Reno is not. 
2. Furthermore, the Superiority in YeAHâ€™s throughput over Scalable is justified as YeAH is a delay-based algorithm and this experiment varies the delay in order to measure the Throughput.

**Without a high delay,** 

There is not much difference in the throughput values measured using these three TCP variants. 

**Non-LFNs :** 

There is no difference in the throughput measured using these TCP variants in spite of varying the Delay.
