# Project review

Your final lab assignment for the semester is to review one of your peers' projects.
You will critique it with respect to how well it applies the techniques we've 
studied in class for experiment design, communicating results, and reproducible research.


This review is due on 4 May at 11:59PM. 

## Identify your assigment

Every student has been assigned one project to review. To identify 
your assigned project, look in NYU Classes, in the Gradebook, at the column labeled
"Review Assignment." 

You should see a number (1-24). This corresponds to one folder in
the [projects](https://bitbucket.org/ffund/el6383/src/master/review/projects/)
section of this repository - the project you are to review is inside 
that folder.

## Guidelines for review

Remember, your review matters:

 * The grade for the project you are reviewing depends partly on your review.

 * *Your* grade depends on the quality of your review. 

Try to be fair and thorough. Don't write a positive review of an obviously substandard 
project; don't write a very critical review of a mostly good project.
Don't get hung up on small issues like occasional typos, 
minor inconsistencies in the instructions, etc.; focus on the big picture 
of the experiment design, presentation of results, and reproducibility.
(Try *not* to be an 
[adversarial reviewer](http://www.sigmod.org/publications/sigmod-record/0812/p100.open.cormode.pdf).)


## Submit your review

Carefully evaluate your assigned project, following the review 
template in the 'submit' folder. Fill in the review, write some 
detailed comments, and then push the 'submit/SUBMIT.md' file
to your Bitbucket repository. (At this stage in the semester, 
you should know how to do this!)

Your (anonymized) review will be shared with the authors of the 
project you are reviewing.
