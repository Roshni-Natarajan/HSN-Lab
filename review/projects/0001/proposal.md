Project idea:

•	What topic in high speed networks is your project related to? (Your topic should be substantially different from the prepared labs you've already completed - "Performance of different TCP variants over networks with a high BDP" is not an acceptable topic, for example.)

Objective: 
The main aim of our project is exploring the effect of queues on packet loss and delay on UDP traffic. The queue size is varied so as to demonstrate the effect on packet loss and delay. We are also evaluating UDT (UDP based data transfer) comparing the performance of UDP based data transfer with respect to TCP in a simple network. We are basically performing file transfer using UDT and FTP and comparing how they work for high speed data transfer under different bandwidth, delay and packet loss probabilities.

•	What is the goal of your experiment? Make sure to follow best practices for setting an experiment goal, as we've discussed in class.

There are two goals to our experiment. Firstly, to study the packet loss and delay depending on the queue size. If the queue size is more, packet loss is less and the delay is more. However, if the queue size is less, there is less packet loss and more delay. This is observed from our experiment. The second goal is that we have compared the speed of file transfer using UDT and FTP schemes. We observe that the speed of file transfer of UDT is higher than that of FTP for high speed transfer.

Be as specific as you can. You should have a narrow goal that dictates a particular experiment design, not a broad open-ended evaluation.
You only have a few weeks for this project; set a realistic goal.
Experiment design
Describe your experiment design, including the following details (refer to lab slides for more information):
•	What is the service you are going to study?
We are going to study the packet loss and delay during transmission in UDP and also the transmission capabilities of UDT and TCP under different environments using the GENI Portal.
•	What metric(s) will you measure?
We are measuring the packet loss, delay in packet transmission and speed of data streams transmission.

•	What parameter(s) will you vary? In what range?
We will be varying the Bandwidth and also limit the sending capacity of the intermediate bottleneck router and find out the variations in delay and packet loss and in case of comparison of UDT and FTP transmission we will be varying bandwidth, delay and packet loss rate.

•	Describe the configuration of your experiment setting (e.g. network environment). What kind of "real" setting is this meant to represent? How do you know this experiment setting is representative? In what ways is your experiment setting not representative?

•	What software will you use for your experiment?
We have used the ns-2 simulator 

•	How will you collect the data from your experiment? Does the software that generates data already output in a machine-friendly format? Will you need to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script to get your data into a useful format? (Manually noting down measurements is not acceptable - your experiment data must be generated by a software process.)
-  The data output of our experiment can be observed in the gitbash console. The software used is the Geni Portal and the outputs generated are in a machine-friendly format. We were not required to modify the software. 

•	What kind of data analysis will you perform on your raw data?
- The collected data is analyzed to study the packet loss and delay.

•	How will you test for interactions between experiment parameters?
- We will plot the outputs graphically which will show the interactions between the different parameters. It will conclude if they are inter-dependent or not.

•	How will you communicate the quantitative experiment results? Sketch any visualization(s) that you expect to create at the end of your experiment, showing your experiment results. Obviously you don't actually have the results yet, but you should know what form they will take; so you can draw a plot with "fake" results. Upload your sketch to any image hosting service, and include it in this document.
- We will be communicating the results using graphical representation of the outputs and using a table format which captures how the parameters and metrics are used to define the experiment result.
