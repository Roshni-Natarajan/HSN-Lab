Project Proposal for EL6383
===========================


## Project idea

Write a 1-2 paragraph summary of your project. Your summary should describe:

* What topic in high speed networks is your project related to? (Your topic should be *substantially* different from the prepared labs you've already completed - "Performance of different TCP variants over networks with a high BDP" is not an acceptable topic, for example.)

**Ans.** Comparison of Random Early Detection scheduling algorithm and the default scheduling algorithm(First Come First Serve) in a LAN which uses static routes between nodes.  

* What is the goal of your experiment? Make sure to follow best practices
for setting an experiment goal, as we've discussed in class.

**Ans.** To evaluate the performance of Random Early Detection scheduling and the default scheduling algorithm (First Come First Serve) in a static route based LAN.

## Experiment design

Describe your experiment design, including the following details (refer to lab slides for more information):

* What is the service you are going to study?

**Ans.** We are going to study the Random Early Detection and First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithms in order to do scheduling in a LAN.

* What metric(s) will you measure?

**Ans.** We are measuring throughput (utilized bandwidth) as the metric.

* What parameter(s) will you vary? In what range?

**Ans.** The scheduling algorithm being used is the parameter we will be varying. The algorithms which our experiment aims to focus on are Random Early Detection and First Come First Serve (FCFS).

* Describe the configuration of your experiment setting (e.g. network environment).
What kind of "real" setting is this meant to represent? How do you know this experiment setting is representative? In what ways is your experiment setting *not* representative?

**Ans.** In this experiment we are using 2 routers and 4 hosts which comprise to form a small LAN segment. It is meant to represent a small segment of LAN in which scheduling algorithms are applied to control the traffic. The Scheduling algorithm is applied on the routers to forward the packets.

* What software will you use for your experiment?

Ans. We will use iperf to calculate the throughput and then use R to statistically represent the data.

* How will you collect the data from your experiment? Does the software that
generates data already output in a machine-friendly format? Will you need
to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script
to get your data into a useful format? (Manually noting down measurements
is not acceptable - your experiment data *must* be generated by a software
process.)

**Ans.** We will use iperf to collect our data. iperf is a commonly used network testing tool that can create TCP and UDP data streams and measure the throughput of the network. Using iperf we can write the data to a text file in a machine friendly format. However, we would need to write a post-experiment processing script to make the data from the text files interpretable by R (for plotting).

* What kind of data analysis will you perform on your raw data?

**Ans.** We will perform a quantitative data analysis in the form of average throughput and standard deviation calculations over a number of runs for each scheduling algorithm.

* How will you test for interactions between experiment parameters?

**Ans.** Since our experiment parameters are the scheduling algorithms, there is no interaction between them.

* How will you communicate the quantitative experiment results? Sketch any
visualization(s) that you expect to create at the end of your
experiment, showing your experiment results. Obviously you don't actually *have*
the results yet, but you should know what form they will take; so you can
draw a plot with "fake" results. Upload your sketch to any image hosting
service, and include it in this document.

**Ans.** We intend to communicate the quantitative experiment results through plots generated by an R script. These plots would be box plots with the scehduling algorithm taken on the X-axis, and the measured throughput taken along the Y-axis.
