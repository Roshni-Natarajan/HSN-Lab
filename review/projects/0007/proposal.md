Project Proposal for EL6383
===========================


## Project idea

	TOPIC :  (SDN) Difference in performance when forwarding is done at the Switch or the Controller.
	
	In the SDN architecture, the packet forwarding decisions can be taken in three places, namely at the (i) Data-Plane or (ii) Switch-CPU or (iii) Controller.
	Because of this design, there is an inherent difference in delay (and consequently on the throughput) and added jitter when the forwarding is done at these three different layers.
	
	GOAL : To measure the difference in performance in terms of delay, throughput and jitter when traffic is switched at the OVS-Switch or at the Controller.

## Experiment design

**What is the service you are going to study?**

	Switching performance.

**What metric(s) will you measure?**

	Delay, Throughput and Jitter.

**What parameter(s) will you vary? In what range?**

	(i)  Switching done at OVS-Switch
	(ii) Switching done at the Controller

**Describe the configuration of your experiment setting (e.g. network environment).**

	Network Setting : Two hosts connected to each other through an OVS-Switch. This OVS-Switch is controlled by a POX controller.
	Experiment		: (i)  OVS-Switch has flows. Send traffic from host-1 to host-2 and measure throughput and delay.
	                  (ii) Controller has flows. Send traffic from host-1 to host-2 and measure throughput and delay.

	This represents the Reactive flow control and Pro-active flow control mechanisms in SDN.

	The first scenario (Controller has flows) is representative of the Reactive flow control mechanism in SDN.
	Whereas the second scenario (OVS-Switch has flows) is representative of the Pro-active flow control mechanism in SDN.

	It is not representative of a real setting because we are just using 2 hosts connected to the OVS-Switch to observe and record the performance.
	Whereas in a real setting there would be a huge number of hosts connected to the OVS-Switch.

**What software will you use for your experiment?**

	These are the softwares being used for the experiment : 
	(i)   GENI
	(ii)  Iperf
	(iii) OpenFlow Virtual Switch
	(iv)  Python to code the POX controller

**How will you collect the data from your experiment? Does the software that generates data already output in a machine-friendly format? Will you need to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script to get your data into a useful format? (Manually noting down measurements is not acceptable - your experiment data *must* be generated by a software process.)**

	Experiment data is collected using the iperf output.
	
	Yes. Iperf outputs the data in the CSV format which is machine-friendly.
	
	No. We wouldn't need to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script.

**What kind of data analysis will you perform on your raw data?**

	The data collected will be plotted in a box graph to differentiate the performance of the switch in the two scenarios.

**How will you test for interactions between experiment parameters?**

	Since the two scenarios are completely independent experiments there wouldn't be any interaction between the experiment parameters.

**How will you communicate the quantitative experiment results? Sketch any visualization(s) that you expect to create at the end of your experiment, showing your experiment results. Obviously you don't actually *have* the results yet, but you should know what form they will take; so you can draw a plot with "fake" results. Upload your sketch to any image hosting service, and include it in this document.**

Similar graphs are to be generated for throughput and jitter.
