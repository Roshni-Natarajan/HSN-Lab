Project Proposal for EL6383
===========================




## Project idea

Write a 1-2 paragraph summary of your project. Your summary should describe:

* What topic in high speed networks is your project related to? (Your topic should be *substantially* different from the prepared labs you've already completed - "Performance of different TCP variants over networks with a high BDP" is not an acceptable topic, for example.)
Our Project is studying the GENI testbed itself, by evaluating the performance of Single aggregate system, Multiple Aggregate System and Multiple Aggregate System that is connected by Stitching.

We will be trying to reproduce the results obtained in the above mentioned Research paper.

Single Aggregate System - We will build a network topology with all the nodes belonging to a single aggregate
Multiple Aggregate System - We will build a network topology with all the nodes belonging to different aggregates.
This experiment will help us understand what design environment can be used for which application,
eg : Single Aggregate System - Multimedia application oriented experiments usually use this because they have strict end-to-end delay requirements.
eg: Multiple Aggregate system - Experiments that need to test the cross traffic behaviour pf protocols will prefer a multiple aggregate system.

* What is the goal of your experiment? Make sure to follow best practices
Goal of the experiment- To contrast the performance of single aggregate system and multiple aggregate system by collecting latency and bandwidth data from our experiment.


## Experiment design

Describe your experiment design, including the following details (refer to lab slides for more information):

* What is the service you are going to study?

We are studying the GENI testbed 

* What metric(s) will you measure?
1. Bandwidth
2. Latency

* What parameter(s) will you vary? In what range?
We will be varying the number of aggregates,
Single Aggregate – We will be using a single aggregate for all 11 nodes of the topology
Multiple Aggregate – We will be using 10 nodes located in 10 different aggregates
In Multiple Aggregates, we will also evaluate it's performance while using stitching

* Describe the configuration of your experiment setting (e.g. network environment).

We will be measuring the performance of the links in two ways: 
First, within an aggregate
Second, in multiple aggregates.
To measure the performance of links within an aggregate we will design an 11-node topology. Since in GENI, multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) can be allotted in the same physical machine/computer (PC), we have to test both the type of links:
The links that connect VMs in the same PC 
The links that connect VMs on different PCs
Although three VMs are enough to test both the cases, the GENI resource allocation is such that it may provide the VMs on the same physical machine. Hence we specify a topology with enough nodes (11 nodes) though we only need to measure the performance of 4 nodes as representatives.
To measure the performance of links from different aggregates, we select 10 aggregates and set up a topology by connecting one node in each of them (i.e. 10 nodes in total).
After the above mentioned evaluation, we will set up a two node topology that connects two different aggregates using stitching and evaluate it's performance.

* What software will you use for your experiment?
We will be using GENI (to run the experiment) and Rstudio (Visualization of results), since our experiment does not demand the usage of any other tools than the ones we learnt in class.

* How will you collect the data from your experiment? Does the software that
generates data already output in a machine-friendly format? Will you need
to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script
to get your data into a useful format? (Manually noting down measurements
is not acceptable - your experiment data *must* be generated by a software
process.)

Links in these two experiments can be divinded in the following categories:
Category 1 (Same PC): the links connecting two VMs that are allocated from the same physical machine (Single Aggregate System)
Category 2 (Same Aggregate): the links connecting two VMs that are allocated from two different physical machines located in the same aggregate (Single Aggregate System)
Category 3 (Different Aggregates): the links connecting two VMs that are allocated from two different physical machines located in two different aggregates (Multiple Aggregate System)
Category 4 (Two Different Aggregates connected using stitching): two nodes in two different aggregates and a link connecting them are set up using stitching.
We will collect latency and bandwidth data over 5 days for each link and calculate the averages of the same.
Since the links in the Same PC category have similar performance, we only choose two links as representatives. For the same reason, we only choose two links as representatives for the Same Aggregate category. However, the performance of the links from the Different Aggregates category varies a lot, we will summarize the results of all the links after performing the experiment.
We will be using Rstudio to visualize the data collected using GENI, thus we will not require any software modification.

* What kind of data analysis will you perform on your raw data?
Graphical and Quantitative analysis:
We will be creating graphs (Rstudio) and tables from our raw data.

* How will you test for interactions between experiment parameters?
To test for interactions we are going to obtain results for all three categories of links and plot those results graphically.
Any interaction present will be represented in the graph clearly.

* How will you communicate the quantitative experiment results? Sketch any
visualization(s) that you expect to create at the end of your
experiment, showing your experiment results. Obviously you don't actually *have*
the results yet, but you should know what form they will take; so you can
draw a plot with "fake" results. Upload your sketch to any image hosting
service, and include it in this document.
