Project Proposal for EL6383
===========================

## Project idea

Write a 1-2 paragraph summary of your project. Your summary should describe:

* What topic in high speed networks is your project related to? (Your topic should be *substantially* different from the prepared labs you've already completed - "Performance of different TCP variants over networks with a high BDP" is not an acceptable topic, for example.)
A: Topic is related to Openflow SDN.

* What is the goal of your experiment? Make sure to follow best practices
for setting an experiment goal, as we've discussed in class.

Be as *specific* as you can. You should have a narrow goal that dictates
a particular experiment design, not a broad open-ended evaluation.

You only have a few weeks for this project; set a realistic goal.

Ans: Build an Openflow network topology one with POX controller on a slice and the other slice with multiple hosts connected to a single switch.
     Show that the Openflow Network is active and working from ping results and calculate the throughput between every two hosts and plot the results (RTT) against ICMP Seq number.

## Experiment design

Describe your experiment design, including the following details (refer to lab slides for more information):

* What is the service you are going to study?
A: Comparitative analysis of the metric between Layer 2 Switching and Layer 3 Switching on a network topology with single controller and three hosts connected to a switch

* What metric(s) will you measure?
A: RTT distribution and Throughput.

* What parameter(s) will you vary? In what range?
A: POX controller with L2 learning mode and with L3 learning mode.

* Describe the configuration of your experiment setting (e.g. network environment).
What kind of "real" setting is this meant to represent? How do you know this experiment setting is representative? In what ways is your experiment setting *not* representative?
A: We are building a network setting where POX controller is configured on one slice which is publicly routable and another network with three hosts
   and a switch (configured to be an OpenVswitch) on another slice.

* What software will you use for your experiment?
A: OpenVswitch : For implementation of an openflow switch
   POX: As a controller
   
* How will you collect the data from your experiment? Does the software that
generates data already output in a machine-friendly format? Will you need
to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script
to get your data into a useful format? (Manually noting down measurements
is not acceptable - your experiment data *must* be generated by a software
process.)

A: We will be capturing ICMP ping data for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching techniques and we will modify the write a shell script(.sh file) to convert the ping
   data into a machine readable data to plot on R.

* What kind of data analysis will you perform on your raw data?
A: We are showing the RTT distribution time it takes for the first packet(to reach through the controller) and following packets to reach the destination when
   we use L2 and L3 Switching techniques.

* How will you test for interactions between experiment parameters?
A: We have configured the Switched in two different ways by pointing the controller for L2 and L3 learning mode(L2 mode includes pointing the controller IP address and 
   port number L3 mode includes additional steps by adding new routing tables).

* How will you communicate the quantitative experiment results? Sketch any
visualization(s) that you expect to create at the end of your
experiment, showing your experiment results. Obviously you don't actually *have*
the results yet, but you should know what form they will take; so you can
draw a plot with "fake" results. Upload your sketch to any image hosting
service, and include it in this document.
A: We used the shell script to seperate the required RTT data into a machine readable format and plot graphs of RTT distribution time against ICMP seq number
   using R programming language.


Be as *specific* as you can.
