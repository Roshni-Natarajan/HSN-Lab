Project Proposal for EL6383
===========================


## Project idea

Write a 1-2 paragraph summary of your project. Your summary should describe:

* What topic in high speed networks is your project related to? (Your topic should be *substantially* different from the prepared labs you've already completed - "Performance of different TCP variants over networks with a high BDP" is not an acceptable topic, for example.)

* What is the goal of your experiment? Make sure to follow best practices
for setting an experiment goal, as we've discussed in class.

Be as *specific* as you can. You should have a narrow goal that dictates
a particular experiment design, not a broad open-ended evaluation.

You only have a few weeks for this project; set a realistic goal.

The project is based on the performance of two transport protocols TCP and UDP on a network with OSPF routing protocol enabled on it. The estimation of data transfer rate and throughput for both the transport protocols on the network will be done by varying the link latency and also some links will be downed and the corresponding metrics will be measureed for the respective cases.


## Experiment design

Describe your experiment design, including the following details (refer to lab slides for more information):

* What is the service you are going to study?

* What metric(s) will you measure?

* What parameter(s) will you vary? In what range?

* Describe the configuration of your experiment setting (e.g. network environment).
What kind of "real" setting is this meant to represent? How do you know this experiment setting is representative? In what ways is your experiment setting *not* representative?

* What software will you use for your experiment?

* How will you collect the data from your experiment? Does the software that generates data already output in a machine-friendly format? Will you need to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script to get your data into a useful format? (Manually noting down measurements is not acceptable - your experiment data *must* be generated by a software process.)

* What kind of data analysis will you perform on your raw data?

* How will you test for interactions between experiment parameters?

* How will you communicate the quantitative experiment results? Sketch any visualization(s) that you expect to create at the end of your experiment, showing your experiment results. Obviously you don't actually *have* the results yet, but you should know what form they will take; so you can draw a plot with "fake" results. Upload your sketch to any image hosting service, and include it in this document.

Be as *specific* as you can.

###ANSWERS

 * The service under study is Link state routing protocols (OSPF) and transport protocols(TCP and UDP)
 * The metrics measured are data transfer rate and throughput. 
 * The parameters varied are transport Protocols , latency (100ms to 300ms) in steps of 100ms , Shutting down links and checking for throughput and data transfer rate. 
 * We will be using 6 routers connected in the topology and 2 nodes ( server and client).
 * The software which would be used to implement the projet are GENI testbed. 
 * iperf output is used to collect data by storing it in a text file. 
 * In the experiment we will be varying the the transport protocols and link latency and correspondingly check for the troughput and data transfer rate in the topology. We  down one and two links in the topology repectively and correspondingly check for throughput and data transfer rate. These results will be used over the specified range and 'R' will be used to perform the data analysis on raw data and the interaction is visualized by plotting bar-graphs.
