Project Proposal for EL6383
===========================



## Project idea

Write a 1-2 paragraph summary of your project. Your summary should describe:

* What topic in high speed networks is your project related to? (Your topic should be *substantially* different from the prepared labs you've already completed - "Performance of different TCP variants over networks with a high BDP" is not an acceptable topic, for example.)

	
As software defined networking are becoming more and more popular, we design an experiment to build an SDN network and a regular network on Geni. By changing link delays, we are expected to evaluate performance between these 2 networks to see if SDN can achieve the same performance as regular networks.

* What is the goal of your experiment? Make sure to follow best practices for setting an experiment goal, as we've discussed in class.
* Be as *specific* as you can. You should have a narrow goal that dictates a particular experiment design, not a broad open-ended evaluation.
* You only have a few weeks for this project; set a realistic goal.
 
Our goals is to evaluate the performance by observing their throughput over different networks. We will vary these parameters: network environment(SDN and regular) and link delays.


## Experiment design

Describe your experiment design, including the following details (refer to lab slides for more information):

* What is the service you are going to study?

 Software Defined Networking (SDN) OpenFlow. 
	
* What metric(s) will you measure?

 Throughput. 
	
* What parameter(s) will you vary? In what range?

Link delays. 100ms and 200ms.
	
* Describe the configuration of your experiment setting (e.g. network environment).

What kind of "real" setting is this meant to represent? How do you know this experiment setting is representative? In what ways is your experiment setting *not* representative?

 Network Environment: SDN & Regular
 Operation System: Linux & Mac
 Test Bed: Geni
 Represent the different situations in the real network environment.
 This experiment setting is representative since we also perform the experiment in regular network environment.
 We don't consider the congestion which can happen during data transformation.

* What software will you use for your experiment?

 Open vSwitch, POX controller, R. 
	
* How will you collect the data from your experiment? Does the software that generates data already output in a machine-friendly format? Will you need
* to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script to get your data into a useful format? (Manually noting down measurements
* is not acceptable - your experiment data *must* be generated by a software process.)

 We collect the data from the commands like "ping", "iperf" and so on. We will use R to process the data. Some of the generated data are in machine-friendly format.

* What kind of data analysis will you perform on your raw data?

 We will use R to process the raw data. We will calculate the mean of throughput from 10 trials and compare their difference by ploting them out.

* How will you test for interactions between experiment parameters?

 We will compare throughput of different link delays in Openflow. And we will compare them in regular network. Then we will test if they have the same impact on throughput in different networks. 

* How will you communicate the quantitative experiment results? Sketch any visualization(s) that you expect to create at the end of your experiment, showing your experiment results. Obviously you don't actually *have*
* the results yet, but you should know what form they will take; so you can draw a plot with "fake" results. Upload your sketch to any image hosting
* service, and include it in this document.

 We will use dot plots to show the relationship between throughput and link delays.

Be as *specific* as you can.
