Project Proposal for EL6383
===========================




## Project idea

Write a 1-2 paragraph summary of your project. Your summary should describe:

Advance performance of Cubic stability among different TCP variances in variant environment.

* What is the goal of your experiment? Make sure to follow best practices
for setting an experiment goal, as we've discussed in class.

Our goal of experiment is to test whether TCP Cubic is better than other TCP variances in stability. We run four flows of a high-speed TCP variant over a long-RTT network path and four flows of long-term TCP-SACK flows over a short-RTT path. These two  paths share a bottleneck link, which is significantly less than link capacity. In this experiment, to  see how stable different protocols become as the buffer space  of the bottleneck router varied, we vary the buffer space of the bottleneck router from 200% to 20% of the BDP of the bottleneck. The background TCP traffic is added to the bottleneck link. 


## Experiment design

Describe your experiment design, including the following details (refer to lab slides for more information):

* What is the service you are going to study?

Advance performance in stability of Cubic as a Congestion Control Algorithm.

* What metric(s) will you measure?

metric(s): Since that no metric of stability is provided for us to compare among several TCP variants, we will use throughput for showing its oscillation to verify that using Cubic can maintain relatively less oscillation, i.e. the better stability.

Using Coefficient of Variation (VoC) of throughput is another approach to measure stability. The one that shows a less VoC is better in stability.

* What parameter(s) will you vary? In what range?

We will vary TCP variants and the buffer space of the bottleneck router from 200% to 20% of the bottleneck’s BDP.

* Describe the configuration of your experiment setting (e.g. network environment).
What kind of "real" setting is this meant to represent? How do you know this experiment setting is representative? In what ways is your experiment setting *not* representative?

We will run four high-speed protocol flows in different TCP variants over a long-RTT (220ms) network path and four long-term TCP-SACK flows over a short-RTT path (20ms). These two paths share a bottleneck link of 2.5Gbps.

The background TCP traffic is added to the bottleneck link. For CUBIC, we set β to 0.8, C to 0.4, and Smax to 160. We will use a dumbbell topology, and for each simulation run, we run four flows of a high-speed protocol and four flows of regular long-term TCP SACK over the same end-to-end paths for the entire duration of the simulation; their starting times and RTTs are slightly varied to reduce the phase effect. About 10% of background traffic is added in both forward and backward directions of the dumbbell setup. For all the experiments unless notes explicitly, the buffer size of Drop Tail routers is set to 100% of BDP.

* What software will you use for your experiment?

Iperf, R, and R studio

* How will you collect the data from your experiment? Does the software that
generates data already output in a machine-friendly format? Will you need
to modify the software, or write a post-experiment processing script
to get your data into a useful format? (Manually noting down measurements
is not acceptable - your experiment data *must* be generated by a software
process.)

We will use iperf to measure throughputs. We can obtain the output files which are generated by the iperf. We don’t need to modify the software or write a script.

* What kind of data analysis will you perform on your raw data?

Coefficient of Variation (CoV) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. In our experiment, we use CoV of throughput to analyze the stability.

* How will you test for interactions between experiment parameters?

There are two parameters: TCP variants and the buffer space.We assume there are interactions between two parameters. We will do tests in every case and analysis what kind of interactions they are. We will do the test with variou TCP in small buffer space; then we will do it in big buffer space. The difference of result in each group of data will show the interacions.

* How will you communicate the quantitative experiment results? Sketch any
visualization(s) that you expect to create at the end of your
experiment, showing your experiment results. Obviously you don't actually *have*
the results yet, but you should know what form they will take; so you can
draw a plot with "fake" results. Upload your sketch to any image hosting
service, and include it in this document.

There will be two group of line charts represent the Throughput of various protocols changing with time, like fig 1. One group is test with 20% buffer while the other group shows test with 200% buffer. After handling those data, there will be other two line charts showing the change of coV(Coefficient of Variation,which represents stability) over time, like fig 2. One is the test with 20% buffer while the other shows test with 200% buffer.
