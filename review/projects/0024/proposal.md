The paper we've chosen is 'Understanding the Performance of TCP and UDP-based Data Transfer Protocals Using EMULAB'.
The purpose of the experiment is to compare the performance of UDP to TCP in a simple network under varing conditions and the conditions we choose here are bandwidth and link delay and the size of the file to be transfered.
